# XcodeAutoindentation

Applescript which automatically loops through all Xcode source files within a workspace and performs "cmd+a", "ctrl+i" (select all and format)

How to run:
1. set the variable folderName to root folder (example: set folderName to "Macintosh Hd:Users:nikita:Develop:MyProject:Classes:", note ":" instead of "\" and ":" at the end)
2. set the variable workspaceName to Xcode project's workspace (example: set workspaceName to "MyProject.xcworkspace")
3. (optional) set file extensions to loop through
4. run script with Script Editor
